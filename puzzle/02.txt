Congratulations, you have progressed to step two. Now that all whom are dumber than my pet rock are gone, I feel it is ok to speak more freely and may not confine myself to the even the rules of an informal essay. Though, because I am relpats_eht, I shall still always use correct grammar and spelling. Anyway, as to prevent any confusion, I will slightly clarify how this contest progresses. As you discover more and more solutions, what you type into the address bar will get longer and longer. By which I mean, if the answer to this page was flibertyjibbet, you would and should head to www.relpats-eht.com/pi/flibertyjibbet, as www.relpats-eht.com/flibertyjibbet would take you to no more than a 404 notice. See you on page three.
