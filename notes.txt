Regarding output of g.py (green channel xored with 1011 (0xB))
	"The true answer is unknown to me, as far as you know"
		Why "as far as [YOU] know"?
	"a bit different, a bit off"
		Turning a bit off could give a non-one-to-one mapping
		There doesn't seem to be a stuck-off bit, at least in a consistent position per word
	"a little bit different"
		Flip a bit?
	"This, of course being a conclusion to something I have written, will make not the smallest bit of sense."
		sense bit as in sign bit?
	"two red eyes"
		Hinting at the red channel of the original message?
	"the sequence of letters r e l p a t s _ e h t happened to emerge more than once"
		Need to find this string in the original message?
	"their wasn't much rising action"
		Should be "there"
	"there is nothing random about it"
		Produced by a prg?
	"the sequence of letters r e l p a t s _ e h t happened to emerge more than once"
		vigenere cipher using relpats_eht as keyword?
